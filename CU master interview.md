I'm Lam Tim Lung, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Business Intelligence from The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, where I graduated with First Class Honours and was recognized on the Dean’s List. Currently, I am a Statistical Assistant at the Census and Statistics Department.

Previously, I worked as a Data Engineer at iEMIS (HK) Limited for one year, where I developed data pipelines for a polyp detection model that achieved over 95% accuracy. I also trained a papilla detection model and integrated the Segment Anything 2 model into existing pipelines to enhance data annotation quality and efficiency.

Additionally, I served as a Student Research Assistant at my university for one year, where I collected 10-K filings from the SEC through web scraping and performed data preprocessing of text data to fine-tune the FinBERT model using PyTorch.

I aspire to advance my career as a Data Engineer, AI Engineer, or Data Scientist. To support my growth, I am currently enrolled in various online courses on Coursera. My goal in applying to this program is to deepen my knowledge in data science, gain direction for my career development, and increase the likelihood of successfully completing my side projects.
