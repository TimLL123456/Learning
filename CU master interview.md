I am Lam Tim Lung. I have a bachelor's degree in Data Science and Business Intelligence from The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong with First Class Honours. I have also been recognized on the Dean’s List during my study.

I am currently working at the Census and Statistics Department as a statistical assistant. I have around 1 year experience as a data engineer at iEMIS (HK) Limited. My duty as a data engineer is to generate report and develop and maintain data pipelines for training a polyp detection model with over 95% accuracy. I also have experience to train a papilla detection model and integrated Segment Anything 2 model into existing data pipelines to improve data annotation quality and efficiency.

I am highly interested in data science. My goal is to be a Data scientist in the future. I am enhancing my knowledge in data science through different online courses in Coursera after my graduation.
